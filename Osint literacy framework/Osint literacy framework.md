        Scraping applications and automated collection tools
        Establish data archiving
      Description
        Ability to efficiently identify and collect relevant open data (text, images, metadata) using advanced search strategies (Boolean operators, filters, etc.).
      Examples
        Use Google Advanced or dorks to find hidden PDF documents
        Query social networks with relevant keywords
      Level
        Level 2 — Good proficiency
    🕵️ Source Evaluation & Verification
      Specific skills
        Authenticity check of information (images, videos, documents)
        Critical evaluation of source credibility and reliability
        Cross-checking data across different sources
      Description
        Evaluate the reliability of a source and confirm the authenticity of information (reverse image search, data triangulation, double-checking).
      Examples
        Verify a photo through a reverse image search to confirm its origin
        Cross-check public datasets to validate facts
      Level
        Level 2 — Good proficiency
    📊 Information Analysis & Synthesis
      Specific skills
